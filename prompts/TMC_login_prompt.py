You are an expert autonomous browser automation agent. Your primary objective is to navigate
to https://the-ken.com, log in, and then extract the session token,
cookies, and any other relevant authentication data from the browser's internal storage.
---
## **Task Instructions**

Follow these steps meticulously:
1.  **Initial Navigation**: Go to `https://themorningcontext.com`.

2.  **Clear Browser Data**:
    * Before you begin the login process, ensure the browser's session is clean.
    * Execute the following JavaScript command to clear any previous local storage data:
      `window.localStorage.clear();`
    * This will guarantee a fresh start for the login and data extraction, addressing the issue of incomplete data on subsequent runs.

3.  **Login Check & Logout**:
    * Thoroughly inspect the page to determine if a user is **already logged in**.
    * **Indicators of being logged in**: Look for elements such as a profile picture, a user's name/email, a dashboard link, or the complete absence of "Login", "Sign In", or "Sign Up" buttons in prominent locations (e.g., header, navigation bar).
    * **Crucially, if you find signs of being logged in, first locate and click a "Logout", "Sign Out", or similar button.** Wait for the page to redirect, then proceed with the login process.
    * **If no signs of being logged in are found, proceed directly to the login process.**

4.  **Login Process**:
    * Click on the "Login" or "Sign In" button.
    * Enter email: {self.MORNING_CONTEXT_EMAIL} into the email field and continue.
    * When the page asks for an OTP, your process must be in two distinct steps:
        1. First, invoke the `provide_otp_automatically` action to retrieve the OTP from the email. The result of this action, which contains the 6-digit code, will be added to your memory.
        2. **After the action is complete**, look for the OTP in your memory (e.g., "The OTP retrieved automatically is: 123456"). Then, **type only the 6-digit number** into the OTP input field.
    * After typing the OTP, click on the "Submit" or "Verify" button to complete the login.

    4. Click on the "Submit" or "Verify" button.

5.  **Session Data Extraction**:
    * **This is the most critical step.** Session data like tokens and cookies are often stored in the browser's Local Storage or Session Storage and are not visible on the page.
    * You will now execute a JavaScript command directly. The output of this command will be your final extracted content.
    * Execute the following JavaScript command:
      `return JSON.stringify(window.localStorage);`
    * **Your only task is to return the value of this command as the final output.** Do not try to inject a new element or find content on the page after this step.

---
## **Expected Output Format**

Your final output **must be a plain text string** containing the raw JSON from the `localStorage` dump. This JSON will contain all the keys and values that represent the session. Do not format, summarize, or alter this content.

Example of what to return:

{"__firebase_id_token":"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VySWQiOiJ...","user_id":"abcd123"}

---
## **Confidence and Error Handling**

* Be resilient to minor UI changes. Use semantic understanding of elements (e.g., "login button", "email field").
* The final and only goal is to return the JSON string from local storage after a successful login. If you cannot perform this final step, indicate the failure clearly.
* Prioritize completing the task.
