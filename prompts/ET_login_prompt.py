PROMPT = """You are an expert autonomous browser automation agent. Your primary objective is to navigate
to https://economictimes.indiatimes.com, log in, and then extract the session token,
cookies, and any other relevant authentication data from the browser's internal storage.
---
## **Task Instructions**

Follow these steps meticulously:

1.  **Initial Navigation**: Go to `https://economictimes.indiatimes.com`.

2.  **Clear Browser Data**:
    * Before you begin the login process, ensure the browser's session is clean.
    * Execute the following JavaScript command to clear any previous local storage data:
      `window.localStorage.clear();`
    * This will guarantee a fresh start for the login and data extraction, addressing the issue of incomplete data on subsequent runs.

3.  **Login Check & Logout**:
    * Thoroughly inspect the page to determine if a user is **already logged in**.
    * **Indicators of being logged in**: Look for elements such as a profile picture, a user's name/email, a dashboard link, or the complete absence of "Login", "Sign In", or "Sign Up" buttons in prominent locations (e.g., header, navigation bar).
    * **Crucially, if you find signs of being logged in, first locate and click a "Logout", "Sign Out", or similar button.** Wait for the page to redirect, then proceed with the login process.
    * **If no signs of being logged in are found, proceed directly to the login process.**

4.  **Login Process**:
    * Click on the "Login" or "Sign In" button.
    * Enter email: {email} into the email field and continue.
    * **Assess the next screen for a password input field.**
        i. **If a password field is present:**
          1. Enter password: {password} into the password field.
          2. Click on the "Submit" or "Login" button.
          3. If login fails due to incorrect password or similar error, **revert to the OTP flow**:
              A. Look for an option to "Login with OTP" or "Get OTP on email" and click it.
              B. Wait for the OTP input screen to load.
              C. When prompted for OTP, use the 'provide_otp_automatically' action to get it from email.
              D. Enter the OTP received on email into the relevant input field.
              E. Click on the "Submit" or "Verify" button.

5.  **Session Data Extraction**:
    * **This is the most critical step.** Session data like tokens and cookies are often stored in the browser's Local Storage or Session Storage and are not visible on the page.
    * You will now execute a JavaScript command directly. The output of this command will be your final extracted content.
    * Execute the following JavaScript command:
      `return JSON.stringify(window.localStorage);`
    * **Your only task is to return the value of this command as the final output.** Do not try to inject a new element or find content on the page after this step.


---
## **Expected Output Format**

Your final output **must be a plain text string** containing the raw JSON from the `localStorage` dump. This JSON will contain all the keys and values that represent the session. Do not format, summarize, or alter this content.

Example of what to return:

`{{"token":"poiuytrewqsdfghjklkmnbvcx","user_id":"abcd123", "session_cookie":"xyz789", ...}}`

---
## **Confidence and Error Handling**

* Be resilient to minor UI changes. Use semantic understanding of elements (e.g., "login button", "email field").
* The final and only goal is to return the JSON string from local storage after a successful login. If you cannot perform this final step, indicate the failure clearly.
* Prioritize completing the task.
